# Ticketmaster Gig Finder

A simple app built using react-native, designed to allow users to search for music events within Great Britain, by making GET requests to the ticketmaster API.  
The user is able to:

- search for events by city
- search for events by venue
- search for events by artist
- filter results by genre
